= Behind a proxy

In a lot of enterprise environments, servers or VMs running on premises do not have direct Internet access. Instead, the connection to external services is done through a HTTP(S) proxy for security reasons. This tutorial shows you how to set up an {elemental-product-name} deployment in such an environment.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This guide will not cover the Rancher installation behind a proxy. It's a different use case and you can find the detailed documentation https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/pages-for-subheaders/rancher-behind-an-http-proxy[here].
====


[NOTE]
====
For this documentation, we assume you are using a SUSE family system (like SLE Micro), so proxy settings have to be written in `/etc/sysconfig/proxy`.
====


Proxy settings must be configured in the following locations:

* Machine Registration Endpoint
* SeedImage resource
* {elemental-product-name} cluster configuration

The `elemental-system-agent` needs proxy settings to reach the Rancher Manager.
To achieve that, you need to fill the cloud-init section of the Machine Registration Endpoint.

You can do it either with xref:quickstart-ui.adoc#_add_a_machine_registration_endpoint[UI] or xref:quickstart-cli.adoc#_prepare_your_kubernetes_resources[CLI].

== {elemental-product-name}-register

xref:architecture-components.adoc#_elemental_register_command_line_tool[{elemental-product-name}-register] is the first communication endpoint between the new host and Rancher Manager, this is the first place where proxy settings need to be set.

[CAUTION]
====
At the time of writing, it's only possible to configure proxy settings for the ISO with the CLI. The proxy settings aren't implemented in the UI.
====

The process happens when you boot your {elemental-product-name} ISO for the first time, in order to configure the proxy settings you have to include a `cloud-init` definition in the ISO.
To do that, you have to create a xref:seedimage-reference.adoc[SeedImage] definition.

[,yaml]
----
include::example$proxy/seedimage-proxy.yaml[]
----

Apply the YAML with `kubectl` and then, print your SeedImage definition to get the URL to download it:

[,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f <my_seedimage_yaml_file>
kubectl get seedimage <seed_image_name> -n <namespace> -o yaml
----

Boot the ISO and you should see your new system appears in xref:machineinventory-reference.adoc[Machine inventory].

== Create {elemental-product-name} cluster

For this step, you can use either the UI or CLI.
