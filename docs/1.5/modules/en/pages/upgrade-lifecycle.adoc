= Upgrade Lifecycle

image::upgrade-lifecycle.png[Upgrade Flow]

== Components

* https://elemental.docs.rancher.com/upgrade[SUSE® Rancher Prime OS Manager Operator]

The SUSE® Rancher Prime OS Manager Operator supports several ways to configure the OS version on a Cluster level. +
Whenever a new `ManagedOSIMage` is defined, a related Fleet `Bundle` is also generated by the SUSE® Rancher Prime OS Manager Operator.

* https://fleet.rancher.io/[Fleet]

In this context, Fleet is used to apply an `upgrade.cattle.io/v1` `Plan` on each Cluster targeted by the `ManagedOSImage`. +
The `Plan` is then executed by the `System Upgrade Controller` running on the downstream SUSE® Rancher Prime OS Manager Cluster.

* https://github.com/rancher/system-upgrade-controller[System Upgrade Controller]

The System Upgrade Controller is an upgrade tool used by https://docs.k3s.io/upgrades/automated[k3s] and https://docs.rke2.io/upgrade/automated_upgrade[rke2] clusters. It should always be automatically installed on each provisioned SUSE® Rancher Prime OS Manager cluster. +
In this context the System Upgrade Controller orchestrates the application of `upgrade.cattle.io/v1` `Plan` to the SUSE® Rancher Prime OS Manager nodes.

== Versioning and components lifecycle

The https://fleet.rancher.io/[Fleet] and https://github.com/rancher/system-upgrade-controller[System Upgrade Controller] versions are controlled by Rancher.

On the Rancher cluster, you can run:

[,bash]
----
kubectl get settings fleet-version system-upgrade-controller-chart-version
----

For more information about chart versions, you can visit the https://github.com/rancher/charts[repository] or read the https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/helm-charts-in-rancher[documentation].

The charts version is determined by Rancher. +
Depending on how Rancher is installed, the following environment variables can be set, for example when installing the https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/installation-references/helm-chart-options#setting-extra-environment-variables[Rancher Helm chart]:

[,bash]
----
CATTLE_SYSTEM_UPGRADE_CONTROLLER_CHART_VERSION
CATTLE_FLEET_VERSION
----

Manually updating the versions is generally not recommended. +
Also beware that a new `CATTLE_SYSTEM_UPGRADE_CONTROLLER_CHART_VERSION` will trigger a `system-upgrade-controller` chart update on all provisioned downstream clusters.

== Verifying successful upgrades

Verifying the correct execution of the upgrade jobs is a fundamental part of ensuring the SUSE® Rancher Prime OS Manager upgrade process is complete.

To troubleshoot each step within the entire upgrade process, please consult the xref:troubleshooting-upgrade.adoc[related document]. +
This section only describes the last step needed to verify the correct application of the upgrade Plan on one targeted cluster.

* Versions higher or equal to *v0.13.4* of the `system-upgrade-controller`:
+
[,shell]
----
kubectl -n cattle-system describe plan os-upgrader-my-upgrade
----
+
Once the Plan is applied to all nodes, it will have a `Complete` status condition.

* Older versions:
+
Each Plan has a `latestHash` status value that should match the Plan label on each node. +
A simple script can be used to list all nodes where the plan has not be applied yet:
+
[,shell]
----
#!/bin/bash

# This script prints a list of all nodes where an upgrade plan was not applied.
# To further determine the cause of failures, you can analyze the Plan status and the related jobs.
# For ex: kubectl -n cattle-system get plans,jobs

# Edit this variable according to your ManagedOSImage name.
MANAGED_OS_IMAGE_NAME=my-upgrade

PLAN_NAME=os-upgrader-$MANAGED_OS_IMAGE_NAME
LATEST_HASH=$(kubectl -n cattle-system get plan $PLAN_NAME -o=jsonpath='{.status.latestHash}')

printf "Plan '$PLAN_NAME' latest hash is: '$LATEST_HASH'\n"

PLAN_LABEL=plan.upgrade.cattle.io/$PLAN_NAME
printf "Listing all nodes with mismatching or missing label '$PLAN_LABEL':\n"
kubectl get nodes -l $PLAN_LABEL!=$LATEST_HASH
