== Install {elemental-product-name} in an Air-Gapped Environment

=== Assumptions

A Rancher air-gapped installation should be already configured as per the https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/pages-for-subheaders/air-gapped-helm-cli-install[official Rancher documentation].
In particular, a private registry should be available in the air-gapped infrastructure.

=== Overview

In order to run {elemental-product-name} in an air-gapped environment the following artifacts are needed:

* the {elemental-product-name} Operator charts
* the container images referenced in the charts (the _elemental-operator_ and _seedimage-builder_ images)
* the containerized OS images

Moreover, it could be handy to create a _channel image_ referencing the containerized OS images available.
The official channel image (the _elemental-channel_ one) references absolute URLs of the OS images on the official suse registry, so it cannot be used as-is in an air-gapped scenario.

=== {elemental-product-name} Air-Gapped installation from the command line

All the required steps can be accomplished by executing the
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher/elemental-operator/main/scripts/elemental-airgap.sh[`elemental-airgap.sh` script]
from a host with Internet access.

The {elemental-product-name} charts are a required parameter to the script and can be provided as downloaded archives, URLs or as one of
the `stable`, `staging` and `dev` keywords, to let the script retrieve the correct chart version for you.

`elemental-airgap.sh` inspects the {elemental-product-name} Operator chart, identifies all the required container images, downloads and saves them in a single docker archive.
It also builds a new OS channel image with the OS image URLs pointing to the private registry passed as argument
(which is a mandatory argument too).

The latest version of the elemental script can be easily downloaded from the official github repo:

[,shell]
----
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher/elemental-operator/main/scripts/elemental-airgap.sh
chmod 755 elemental-airgap.sh
----

Let's now download all the artifacts and build a custom channel from the latest stable release of {elemental-product-name}:

[tabs]
====
Create a Docker archive::
+
======
[,shell]
----
./elemental-airgap.sh stable -r <REGISTRY.YOURDOMAIN.COM:PORT>
----

once completed (the script may take a while) the following files will be available in the current dir:

* `elemental-operator-crds-chart-<*VERSION*>.tgz`
* `elemental-operator-chart-<*VERSION*>.tgz`
* `elemental-images.txt`
* `elemental-images.tar.gz`
======

Create a Hauler archive::
+
======
[,shell]
----
./elemental-airgap.sh -ha stable -r <REGISTRY.YOURDOMAIN.COM:PORT>
----

once completed (the script may take a while) both the charts and the container images will be packed in the hauler archive named `elemental-haul.tar.zst`.
======
====

==== {elemental-product-name} installation 

The files and archives created by the script should be copied to a host which: 

* Has access to the private registry. 
* Has the kubectl binary installed and configured to access the air-gapped Rancher cluster. 
* Has the helm binary installed. 

[tabs]
========
Install from a Docker archive::
+
======
If the private registry requires authentication you need to log with docker into it: 

[,shell]
----
docker login <REGISTRY.YOURDOMAIN.COM:PORT>
----

Two steps are needed to perform the {elemental-product-name} installation: 

* load the archive with all the required container images on the private registry: this could be done using the `rancher-load-images.sh` script distributed with the Rancher release and already used for the Rancher air-gapped deployment: 

[,shell]
----
rancher-load-images.sh \ 
    --image-list elemental-images.txt \ 
    --images elemental-images.tar.gz \ 
    --registry <REGISTRY.YOURDOMAIN.COM:PORT>
----

* install the downloaded elemental charts configuring the local registry and the newly created channel: 

[,shell]
----
helm upgrade --create-namespace -n cattle-elemental-system \ 
    --install elemental-operator-crds elemental-operator-crds-chart-<VERSION>.tgz 
    
helm upgrade --create-namespace -n cattle-elemental-system \ 
    --install elemental-operator elemental-operator-chart-<VERSION>.tgz \ 
    --set registryUrl=<REGISTRY.YOURDOMAIN.COM:PORT>\ 
    --set channel.repository=rancher/elemental-channel-<REGISTRY.YOURDOMAIN.COM>
----
======

Install from a Hauler archive::
+
======
To install from a https://rancherfederal.github.io/hauler-docs/[Hauler] archive (`-ha` option in `elemental-airgap.sh`) Hauler installation is also a requirement on the host from where the installation is performed. 

If the private registry requires authentication you need to log with Hauler into it: 

[,shell]
----
hauler login <REGISTRY.YOURDOMAIN.COM:PORT>-u $USERNAME -p $PASSWORD
----

Three steps are needed to perform the {elemental-product-name} installation: 


* Load the 'elemental-haul.tar.zst' Haul archive in the Hauler instance in the airgapped infrastructure: 

[,shell]
----
hauler store load 'elemental-haul.tar.zst' 
----

* If the local registry in the air-gapped environment is not server by Hauler, load the Haul archive in the local registry: 

[,shell]
----
hauler store copy registry://<REGISTRY.YOURDOMAIN.COM:PORT>
----

[NOTE]
.Hauler can also serve as a registry
====
In case the air-gapped local registry is served by an Hauler instance, just load the Haul archive directly there (as shown in step (1)) and skip step (2).
====

* Extract the elemental charts from the Hauler store and install them: 

[,shell]
----
hauler store extract elemental-operator-crds-chart-<ELEMENTAL-VERSION>.tgz 
hauler store extract elemental-operator-chart-<ELEMENTAL-VERSION>.tgz 

helm upgrade --create-namespace -n cattle-elemental-system \ 
    --install elemental-operator-crds elemental-operator-crds-chart-<ELEMENTAL-VERSION>.tgz 
helm upgrade --create-namespace -n cattle-elemental-system \ 
    --install elemental-operator elemental-operator-chart-<ELEMENTAL-VERSION>.tgz \ 
    --set registryUrl=<REGISTRY.YOURDOMAIN.COM:PORT>\ -
    --set channel.repository=rancher/elemental-channel-<REGISTRY.YOURDOMAIN.COM:PORT>
----
======
========

[NOTE]
.The elemental airgap script outputs the required commands 
====
The `elemental-airgap.sh` scripts prints out the required commands shown above but using the actual chart version and the provided registry URL to allow to easily copy and paste the exact commands.

=== {elemental-product-name} Air-Gapped installation from the Rancher Marketplace 

A Rancher air-gapped installation includes also the {elemental-product-name} Operator charts and the operator and seedimage container images. 

To collect the missing OS images and to build an OS channel image for your private registry execute the https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher/elemental-operator/main/scripts/elemental-airgap.sh[`elemental-airgap.sh` script] from an host with Internet access, using the `-co` option. 

As an example, let's target the `elemental-channel` image from the latest stable release of {elemental-product-name}. The script will take care of downloading the {elemental-product-name} operator chart (if needed), extract the OS channel image URL, download it, inspect all the OS images referenced, download all of them and create a new OS channel with links to the private registry of the air-gapped scenario. 

[tabs]
========
Create a Docker archive::
+
======
[,shell]
----
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher/elemental-operator/main/scripts/elemental-airgap.sh 
chmod 755 elemental-airgap.sh 
./elemental-airgap.sh stable -co -r <REGISTRY.YOURDOMAIN.COM:PORT>
----

once completed (the script may take a while) the following files will be available in the current dir: 

- `elemental-operator-crds-chart-<*VERSION*>.tgz` 
- `elemental-operator-chart-<*VERSION*>.tgz` 
- `elemental-images.txt` 
- `elemental-images.tar.gz`  
======

Create a Hauler archive::
+
======
[,shell]
----
./elemental-airgap.sh -ha -co stable -r <REGISTRY.YOURDOMAIN.COM:PORT>
----

once completed (the script may take a while) the container images will be packed in the hauler archive named `elemental-haul.tar.zst`.  
======
========

==== {elemental-product-name} installation 

The generated archive should be loaded to the air-gapped private registry. 

[tabs]
========
Install from a Docker archive::
+
======
If the private registry requires authentication you need to log with docker into it: 
[,shell]
----
docker login <REGISTRY.YOURDOMAIN.COM:PORT>
----

The script will print out the commands required to load the images via the Rancher `rancher-load-images.sh` tool, used for the Rancher air-gapped installations. It should be something like: 

[,shell]
----
NEXT STEPS: 

1) Load the 'elemental-images.tar.gz' to the local registry (<REGISTRY.YOURDOMAIN.COM:PORT>) available in the airgapped infrastructure: 

./rancher-load-images.sh \ 
    --image-list elemental-images.txt \ 
    --images elemental-images.tar.gz \ 
    --registry <REGISTRY.YOURDOMAIN.COM:PORT>
----

Once the OS and channel images are loaded, you should skip the point (2) from the script output (which will install the {elemental-product-name} charts from the downloaded archives) and instead perform the {elemental-product-name} Operator installation from the Rancher UI.  
======

Install from a Hauler archive::
+
======
If the private registry requires authentication you need to log with Hauler into it: 
[,shell]
----
hauler login <REGISTRY.YOURDOMAIN.COM:PORT>-u $USERNAME -p $PASSWORD 
----

The script will print out the commands required to load the images. It should be something like: 

[,shell]
----
NEXT STEPS: 

* Load the 'elemental-haul.tar.zst' Haul archive in the Hauler instance in the airgapped infrastructure: 

hauler store load 'elemental-haul.tar.zst' 

* If the local registry in the air-gapped environment is not server by Hauler, load the Haul archive in the local registry: 

hauler store copy registry://<REGISTRY.YOURDOMAIN.COM:PORT>
----

Once the OS and channel images are loaded, you should skip the point (3) from the script output (which will install the {elemental-product-name} charts from the downloaded archives) and instead perform the {elemental-product-name} Operator installation from the Rancher UI.
======

When requested, put the full path of the OS channel image just uploaded in your private registry: 

image:airgap-os-channel-image.png[]

=== {elemental-product-name} UI Extension 

Rancher 2.7.x doesn't support UI extensions plugin in air-gapped environments, and so the {elemental-product-name} UI is not available in Rancher 2.7.x. 

The {elemental-product-name} UI plugin will be present in the available UI extensions in Rancher 2.8.0.
