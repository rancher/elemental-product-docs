= Network configuration with {elemental-product-name}
:revdate: 2025-10-27
:page-revdate: {revdate}

{elemental-product-name} cloud-config support does not include declarative networking at the moment.

The default OS channel shipped with {elemental-product-name} provides SLE Micro OS images with https://networkmanager.dev[NetworkManager] which enables DHCP ethernet configuration automatically.

xref:cloud-config-reference.adoc[{elemental-product-name} cloud-config] allows to create NetworkManager connection profile configuration files in order to customize the host network.

To define custom network configuration for your {elemental-product-name} OS deployment the required steps are:

* Identify the content of the desired NetworkManager connection profile configuration files
* Include a `write_files` cloud-config snippet in the {elemental-product-name} xref:machineregistration-reference.adoc[MachineRegistration] resource to create configuration files with content identified in the previous step

[NOTE]
====
The cloud-config configuration put in the {elemental-product-name} xref:machineregistration-reference.adoc[MachineRegistration] is applied on the installed system only, not on the generated ISO/Image.
This means that when booting from the {elemental-product-name} ISO/Image the xref:machineregistration-reference.adoc[MachineRegistration] cloud-config is not applied on the host: it will be applied only after the OS is installed and rebooted.

Host configuration during {elemental-product-name} ISO/Image boot is possible adding the cloud-config customization in the xref:seedimage-reference.adoc[SeedImage] resource instead of the xref:machineregistration-reference.adoc[MachineRegistration] one.

== Identify NetworkManager connection profile configuration files content

NetworkManager supports multiple connection profile storage formats.
While one could focus on any of the supported configuration file plugins, the https://networkmanager.dev/docs/api/latest/nm-settings-keyfile.html[keyfile plugin] is the one we recommend: it allows to store all the possible connection profile data and has a quite simple syntax.

NetworkManager keyfiles can be written directly following the https://networkmanager.dev/docs/api/latest/nm-settings-keyfile.html[nm-settings-keyfile man page].

Anyway, it could be easier to instruct NetworkManager to configure a connection profile if a live system is available: NetworkManager then creates the keyfiles for us in the `/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/` directory.

There are multiple different ways to interact with NetworkManager and create connection profiles. The most used and handy configuration tools include:

* https://networkmanager.dev/docs/api/latest/nmcli.html[nmcli] - the NetworkManager CLI
* https://networkmanager.dev/docs/api/latest/nmtui.html[nmtui] - the NetworManager Text User Interface
* the UI applets present in all the major linux desktops environments

Finally, to generate NetworkManager keyfiles _offline_ using a declarative approach, one could use the https://github.com/suse-edge/nm-configurator[nm-configurator] project.

.Example: generate a static IPv4 ethernet connection porfile with nmcli
[,shell]
----
nmcli connection add \
  con-name fixed-ip \
  type ethernet \
  ipv4.method manual \
  ipv4.addresses 192.168.1.2/24 \
  ipv4.gateway 192.168.1.1 \
  ipv4.dns 192.168.1.1
----

After running the above command, you will find your keyfile at
`/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/fixed-ip.nmconnection`.

== {elemental-product-name} cloud-config

The NetworkManager connection profile keyfiles can be injected in a [MachineRegistration](machineregistration-reference) using the `write_files` module.

The `content` can be either plain text or base64 encoded (`encoding: b64`).

.Example: MachineRegistration with static IPv4 ethernet connection profile
[,yaml]

        reboot: true

[CAUTION]
====
The connection profile keyfile file permissions should allow read and write access to the root user only, otherwise NetworkManager will refuse to load the connection profile: ensure to set `permissions` to `600` for NetworkManager keyfiles, otherwise your connection profiles will not be loaded.
