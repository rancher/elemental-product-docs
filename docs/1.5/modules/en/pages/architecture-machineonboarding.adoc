= Machine onboarding

The goal of the Machine Onboarding service is to register a new machine in the {elemental-product-name} Operator catalog (xref:machineinventory-reference.adoc[MachineInventory] resources) and provision the host with the OS, applying the desired configuration.

The Machine Onboarding involves the following steps:

* The user creates a xref:machineregistration-reference.adoc[MachineRegistration] resource: the MachineRegistration includes the configuration required for the OS installation.
As soon as the MachineRegistration is created, the {elemental-product-name} Operator exposes an HTTP _registration endpoint_: it is the entrypoint required by the onboarding hosts to register to the operator.
* The user requests a self-installing image via a xref:seedimage-reference.adoc[SeedImage] resource: it only requires a reference to a MachineRegistration resource and to an OS container image compatible with the {elemental-product-name} Toolkit.
As soon as the SeedImage is created, the {elemental-product-name} Operator triggers the build process of the self-installing image: once completed, the URL is exposed in the `status.downloadURL` field of the xref:seedimage-reference.adoc[SeedImage] resource.
* The user downloads the self-installing image and uses it to boot an unprovisioned host:
the host https://elemental.docs.rancher.com/authentication[authenticates] to the _registration endpoint_ of the {elemental-product-name} Operator, gets the full configuration stored in the MachineRegistration and installs the OS on the local storage device. As soon as the host has completed the registration process, the {elemental-product-name} Operator creates a unique xref:machineinventory-reference.adoc[MachineInventory] resource tracking the host.
The self-installing image can be used to onboard any number of hosts.
