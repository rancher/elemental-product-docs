== {elemental-product-name} hostname management overview

When a host boots from the {elemental-product-name} ISO, the hostname is temporarily set (_transient hostname_) to the one provided from the DHCP server.
If the DHCP server doesn't provide a hostname, the {elemental-product-name} ISO provides a transient hostname
in the form: `rancher-$\{RANDOM}`.

As soon as the boot process is finished, the registration phase kicks in: the host connects to
the {elemental-product-name} Operator, which creates a `MachineInventory` for the host.
Each host registered with the {elemental-product-name} Operator is tracked by a `MachineInventory` resource.

*The `name` of the `MachineInventory` resource associated with the node is the permanent (static) hostname*
*eventually set to the host*.
This permanent hostname *is set on the node during the K8s cluster provisioning phase only*.
Before the K8s provisioning phase, the node hostname is either the DHCP assigned one or `rancher-$\{RANDOM}`.

For the remainder of this section we will refer to the `hostname` meaning the _permanent_ hostname,
i.e., the hostname that is set after the host has been provisioned as part of a K8s cluster.

== Default hostname

The default name assigned to each newly created MachineInventory is in the form `m-{$UUID}`.
When the host is provisioned as part of a Cluster, that `m-\{UUID}` name is set as the hostname of
the corresponding host, overriding the previous assigned hostname (`rancher-{$RANDOM}` or the DHCP assigned one).

== Set a custom hostname

The hostname can be specified setting the xref:machineregistration-reference.adoc#_machinename[`machineName`] field in the
xref:machineregistration-reference.adoc['MachineRegistration'] resource.

The hostname set in the `machineName` field is expected to be in a template form, in order to be uniquely generated
for each registering node, using xref:smbios.adoc[SMBIOS] and xref:hardwarelabels.adoc[Hardware Labels] data.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `machineName` field in the `MachineRegistration` resource is used as the blueprint not
only for the hostname of the registering host, but also for the name of the `MachineInventory` resource
created to track the host.

This means that if you don't use a templated `machineName` such to generate a unique name for each
host that will boot using the same `MachineRegistration` data (i.e., the same ISO), only the first
registering host will be successful while the others will fail: the `MachineInventory` name must be
unique.

== Keep the hostname assigned from DHCP

In order to keep the hostname assigned from the DHCP server before the host registers to the operator,
the `MachineRegistration` xref:machineregistration-reference.adoc#_machinename[`machineName field`] should be set
to the `${System Data/Runtime/Hostname}` xref:hardwarelabels.adoc[Hardware Label].

This way {elemental-product-name} will use the current hostname as the `MachineInventory` name during
the registration phase, which will be later set as the static hostname of the host during the
provisioning phase.
